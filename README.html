  <h2>In Inkscape...</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Create a simple shape.</b> All measurement units are supported, but 'pixels' is preferred. Single-part shapes are better, but islands/lakes are supported. Multi-shape drawings are supported, but individual styles will be lost. The shape must not be in a group. Clear any transformations if you can before saving.</li>
    <li><b>Set the document size</b> to the size of the shape (Ctrl+Shift+D for document properties).</li>
    <li><b>Save as Plain SVG</b> to your destination of choice.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>In QGIS...</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Select the input .svg file</b> that you created in Inkscape</li>
    <li><b>Select the output .svg</b> to your destination of choice. It is recommended that you choose the default QGIS User SVG folder (see Settings &rarr; Options &rarr; System &rarr; SVG Paths)</li>
    <li><b>Set fill and outline colors</b> for the default style. Notice the output preview update as the changes are made.</li>
    <li><b>Click OK to save the symbol</b></li>
